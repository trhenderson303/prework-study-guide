# Bootcamp Pre-Work Study Guide

## Description

The Bootcamp Pre-Work Study Guide is a basic webpage with information on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git - 4 of the foundational pieces of creating a webpage. The webpage organizes the subjects neatly, and can be updated in the future as my knowledge and skills grow. Though I had some experience with the basics of HTML and CSS, I was able to get familiar with a lot of essential tools like using the command line and various aspects of git hub. In addition to learning the tools of web development, I hope become more digitally literate in general during this bootcamp, and I think that this project helped me to begin seeing how different pieces fit together.
